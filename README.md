# Shabbir — Portfolio

A minimalist grey‑noir portfolio built with pure HTML/CSS/JS, optimized for **GitHub Pages**.

## Quick deploy
1. Create a repository named `<username>.github.io` (you already have one).
2. Upload the contents of this zip at the repo root.
3. Enable Pages (if needed): Settings → Pages → Branch: `main`.
4. Visit `https://<username>.github.io` after a minute.

## Structure
- `index.html` — home
- `projects/` — per‑project detail pages
- `blog/` — simple blog with static posts
- `assets/style.css` — one theme file (grey/black), easy to tweak
- `assets/app.js` — small behavior sugar
- `assets/resume.pdf` — your résumé

## Editing
Search for text and replace in place. No build tools required.
